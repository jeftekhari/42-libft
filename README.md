# libft
Self-Made C Library

My first project as a 42 Cadet!

## Challenges
- Basic C and Programming Concepts
- Time Management
- Algorithms and Optimization
- Makefiles
- Lists, Memory, ASCII

This was a challenging experience at the time. After I passed the C Piscine and got accepted to 42, I initially struggled to retain and reproduce the work I had done. The Piscine was so fast-paced, I couldnt remember even the most basic things we had learned. So I took a few weeks to re-do almost everything we had worked on during our time. It helped immensely. I was able to successfully recreate 60+ functions that are in the standard C library.

Another challenge was learning how to manage my time wisely. In the Piscine, we had no time, so we were constanly working at full-steam. Now, as a Cadet, everything is at my own pace. I have to push myself to maintain a good working schedule while also making time for myself.


Upon cloning the repository, please type `Make` in the directory to activate the Makefile. The Makefile is a special type of file that allows anyone to customize a project. It is resemblant of a Dockerfile when using Docker. It executes whatever commands the user wants it to, and allows for easy compilation of large projects with a simple command.

Commands you can run in the directory:

- `make`: compiles the *.c* files and creates *.o* (output) files with the same names. Also creates a *.a* archive library file that is imperative when using your libft in other projects.
- `make clean`: removes all the *.o* files from your directory.
- `make fclean`: removes all the *.o* files and the *.a* files. Basically a factory reset for the directory.
- `make re`: removes everything and then recompiles everything.


Here are a few pics of the project!
